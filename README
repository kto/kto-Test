dropship - Dropbox API utilities
============================================================

These utilities make use of the deduplication scheme of Dropbox__
to allow for "teleporting" files into your Dropbox account
given only a list of hashes, provided of course that the files already exist
on their servers. This enables arbitrary, anonymous transfers of files between 
Dropbox accounts.

__ http://www.dropbox.com

This package includes:

* ``dropship``: Inject a file into your account using a JSON 
  description.
* ``hash_blocks``: Produce a description from a file that can
  be used with ``dropship``.
